## Ingredients (For a 6-inch cake pan)
- 2 Large eggs
- 70 g Granulated sugar
- 65 g Cake flour
- 10 mL Milk 
- 20 mL Oil
- 1/8 tsp Vanilla extract
- Whipped Cream: 400 g Heavy cream + 30 g Granulated sugar
- Fruits of choice

## Steps
1. Preheat the oven 
2. Combine oil, milk, and vanilla extract together to form the wet ingredients. Set aside for later. 
3. Sift flour and set aside for later.
4. Combine sugar and eggs together. Whip it on high speed until ribbons form. **After ribbons form, continue to mix for 5 minutes on the lowest speed to reduce large air bubbles.**
5. Pour the sifted flour into the whipped sugar and egg mixture. Stir with a spatula gently until all the flour is incorporated. 
6. Immediately pour the wet ingredients into the mixture. Continuously stir with a spatula until the desired texture is achieved. The batter should flow quickly with a smooth ribbon consistency. **Be careful not to undermix or overmix.**
7. Pour the cake batter into the baking pan. Drop the pan from a slightly elevated height to reduce air bubbles. 
8. Bake at 355F | 180C for about 25 - 30 mins. To test if the cake is done, lightly press the top of the cake to see if it bounces back. If not, continue to bake for a few more minutes. 
9. Cool the cake completely.
10. To create the whipped cream, combine heavy cream and sugar and whip on high speed until stiff peaks are formed.  
11. Frost the cake and decorate with fruits before serving.
