        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 Large eggs</li>
                <li>70 g Granulated sugar</li>
                <li>65 g Cake flour</li>
                <li>10 mL Milk</li>
                <li>20 mL Oil</li>
                <li>1/8 tsp Vanilla extract</li>
                <li>Whipped Cream: 400 g Heavy cream + 30 g Granulated sugar</li>
                <li>Fruits of choice</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven</li>
                <li>Combine oil, milk, and vanilla extract together to form the wet ingredients. Set aside for later.</li>
                <li>Sift flour and set aside for later.</li>
                <li>Combine sugar and eggs together. Whip it on high speed until ribbons form. <strong>After ribbons form, continue to mix for 5 minutes on the lowest speed to reduce large air bubbles.</strong></li>
                <li>Pour the sifted flour into the whipped sugar and egg mixture. Stir with a spatula gently until all the flour is incorporated.</li>
                <li>Immediately pour the wet ingredients into the mixture. Continuously stir with a spatula until the desired texture is achieved. The batter should flow quickly with a smooth ribbon consistency. <strong>Be careful not to undermix or overmix.</strong></li>
                <li>Pour the cake batter into the baking pan. Drop the pan from a slightly elevated height to reduce air bubbles.</li>
                <li>Bake at 355F | 180C for about 25 - 30 mins. To test if the cake is done, lightly press the top of the cake to see if it bounces back. If not, continue to bake for a few more minutes.</li>
                <li>Cool the cake completely.</li>
                <li>To create the whipped cream, combine heavy cream and sugar and whip on high speed until stiff peaks are formed.</li>
                <li>Frost the cake and decorate with fruits before serving. </li>
            </ol>
